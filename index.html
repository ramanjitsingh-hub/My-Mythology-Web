        <h1>What is Mythology?</h1>
        <p id="top_question_answer">
            Mythology refers to the collected myths of a group of people their body of stories which they tell to explain nature, history, and customs.
             It can also refer to the study of such myths.
             All cultures have developed their own mythology over time. Mythology includes the legends of their history, their religions, their stories of how the world was created, and their heroes. 
             These stories have great symbolic power, and this may be a major reason why they survive as long as they do, sometimes for thousands of years.
