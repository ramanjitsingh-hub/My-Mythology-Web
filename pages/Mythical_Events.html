                     The vast majority of these tales are just stories people have handed down through the ages. <br>
                     But a few have roots in real geological events of the past, providing warning of potential dangers <br>
                     and speaking to the awe we hold for the might of the planet. <br>

                            In the well-known story told among Christians, Jews and Muslims (and in movie theaters this week), <br>
                             God chose to destroy the Earth with a great flood but spared one man, Noah, and his family. On God’s <br>
                              command, Noah built a huge boat, an ark, and filled it with two of every animal. God covered the Earth <br>
                               with water, drowning everyone and everything that once roamed the land. Noah, his family and the animals <br>
                                on the ark survived and repopulated the planet. <br>

                        <p>
                            In ancient Greece, in the town of Delphi on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, there was a temple devoted to the god Apollo. <br>
                            Within a sacred chamber, a priestess called the Pythia would breathe in sweet-smelling vapors emanating from a crack in the rock. <br>
                             These vapors would send her into a state of frenzy during which she would channel Apollo and speak gibberish. A priest would <br>
                              then turn that gibberish into prophesies. <br>

                        <p>
                            Plato, the ancient Greek philosopher, wrote of a great civilization called Atlantis founded by a race of people <br>
                             who were half god and half human. They lived in a utopia that held great naval power. But their home, located on <br>
                              islands shaped like a series of concentric circles, was destroyed in a great cataclysm. <br>

                        <p>
                            Pele came to Hawaii with her sisters and other relatives. She started in Kauai. There she met a man, Lohi’au, but she <br>
                            did not stay because there was no land hot enough for her liking. She eventually settled in the crater at Kilauea on the <br>
                             big island of Hawaii and asked her sister Hi’iaka to return for Lohi’au. In return, Hi’iaka asked that Pele not destroy <br>
                              her beloved forest. Hi’iaka was given 40 days for the task but did not return in time. Pele, thinking that Hi’iaka and <br>
                              Lohi’au had become romantically entangled, set the forest on fire. After Hi’iaka discovered what had happened, she made <br>
                               love to Lohi’au in view of Pele. So Pele killed Lohi’au and threw his body into her crater. Hi’iaka dug furiously to  <br>
                               recover the body, rocks flying as she dug deeper. She finally recovered his body, and they are now together. <br>

                        <p>
                            In the Hindu epic the Ramayana, Sita, the wife of the god Rama, is kidnapped and taken to the Demon Kingdom on the island of <br>
                             Lanka. Bears and monkeys help Rama and his brother Lakshman by building a floating bridge between India and Lanka. Rama leads <br>
                             an army of monkey-like men and rescues his wife.

                        <p>
                            The Kom people in Cameroon lived for a short time in the land of the Bamessi. The leader, or Fon, of the Kom discovered a plot by <br>
                            the Bamessi Fon to kill all the young men in his kingdom, and the Kom Fon vowed revenge. He told his sister he would hang himself <br>
                            and the fluids from his body would form a lake. The Kom were not to go near the lake—they were to leave the fish for the Bamessi <br>
                            and should prepare themselves to leave the region on the day that was set for catching fish. On that day, when the Bamessi entered <br>
                            the lake to fish, the lake exploded (or imploded or sank, depending on the storyteller), drowning everyone. <br>
