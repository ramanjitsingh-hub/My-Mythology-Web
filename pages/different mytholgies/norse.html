                         they had their own vibrant native pagan religion that was as harshly <br> beautiful as the Nordic landscape to which it was intimately connected. <br>
                         The centerpiece of that religion was what we today call “Norse mythology:” <br> the set of religious stories that gave meaning to the Vikings lives. 
                        These myths revolved <br> around gods and goddesses with fascinating and highly complex characters, <br> such as Odin, Thor, Freya, and Loki.</p>

                        Celtic mythology is the body of myths belonging to the Celtic peoples. <br>
                         Like other Iron Age Europeans, Celtic peoples followed a polytheistic religion <br>
                         having many gods and goddesses. The mythologies of continental Celtic peoples <br>
                         such as the Gauls and Celtiberians, did not survive their conquest by the Roman Empire, <br>
                         the loss of their Celtic languages and their subsequent conversion to Christianity. <br>
                         Only remnants are found in Greco-Roman sources and archaeology.<br>
                          Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples <br>
                          (the Gaels of Ireland and Scotland; the Celtic Britons of western Britain and Brittany) <br>

                        The Aztec Mythology that is known today is a result of the Spanish conquest <br> of the Aztec Empire.
                         The Aztecs were a Mesoamerican people who lived in central Mexico<br> in the 14th and 15th centuries. <br>
                          The Aztecs were one of the most advanced civilizations of the time. They were skilled astronomers,  <br>
                          mathematicians, and artists. They had a complex system of government, religion, and social structure. <br>
                           They also had a rich mythology, which was influenced by their religion and culture. <br>

                    <p>Chinese mythology is mythology that has been passed down in oral form or recorded in <br> literature in the 
                         geographic area now known as Greater China. Chinese mythology includes many varied <br> myths from regional  
                         and cultural traditions. Much of the mythology involves exciting stories full of fantastic<br> people and 
                         beings, the use of magical powers, often taking place in an exotic mythological place or<br> time. Like many 
                         mythologies, Chinese mythology has in the past been believed to be, at least in part, a <br>factual recording 
                          of history. Along with Chinese folklore, Chinese mythology forms an important part of <br>Chinese folk

                                Japanese mythology is a collection of traditional stories, folktales, and beliefs that emerged <br>
                                in the islands of the Japanese archipelago. Shinto and Buddhist traditions are the cornerstones <br>
                                 of Japanese mythology.[1] The history of thousands of years of contact with Korea, Ainu, and <br>
